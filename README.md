Use [HASSCTL](https://github.com/dale3h/hassctl) to have some of these super simple commandline shortcuts for starting, stopping, upgrading, and debugging HA.
Don't forget to modify the configuration file "/etc/hassctl.conf" according to your type of H.A. installation (Hassbian, AIO, Hass.io, ecc).
```
hassctl update-hass
hassctl start
hassctl stop
hassctl error
hassctl log - Follow the Home Assistant logs (errors are highlighted)
hassctl zwave - Follow the Open Z-Wave logs
```
